# Youtube-Channel-Watch-Count-Program
This small project that I made uses Python to count how many times you watch a Youtube channel, and saves it when you quit the program. It has features like entering a channel name, seeing all the data, or deleting or subtracting a watch count from a Youtube channel if you mistakenly typed the wrong name.
